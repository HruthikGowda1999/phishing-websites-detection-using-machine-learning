There is a wide range of genetic diversity of dry bean which is the most
produced one among the edible legume crops in the world. Seed quality
is definitely influential in crop production. Therefore, seed classification
is essential for both marketing and production to provide the principles
of sustainable agricultural systems. The primary objective of this study is
to provide a method for obtaining uniform seed varieties from crop
production, which is in the form of population, so the seeds are not
certified as a sole variety. Thus, a computer vision system was developed
to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with
similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification.
For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different
registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera.
With these results, the demands of the producers and the customers are
largely met about obtaining uniform bean varieties.


Problem Statement:
The given dataset- “Dry Bean Dataset” was obtained from images of 13,611
grains of seven different registered dry beans that were taken with a high resolution camera. The dataset contains 16 features, 12 dimensions and 4 shape
forms of the grains.
When such parameters are specified, the models need to predict the
category/class, the grain belongs to. Uniform seed Classification should be
performed.
Accuracy score of different models need to be measured and compared.
Exploratory Data Analysis need to be done and meaningful graphs has to be
plotted. Relationship between various parameters need to be analysed.


Objective:
• The type of the model to use for the given problem statement should be
identified. The dry beans should be classified into the respective classes as
per the specified parameters.
• The given dataset contains missing values, so appropriate method to fill those
values should be used.
• Clean the dataset and pass the dataset to an algorithm. The data should be
scaled and then fit.
• Accuracy score is found out for that particular algorithm.
• Grid search could be used to get better accuracy score.
• Pass the various parameters into the algorithm and check if it is classifying it
to its respective class correctly.
• Exploratory Data Analysis has to be done and graphs should be plotted.
Necessary conclusion and relationship between various parameters in every
graph should be obtained.
